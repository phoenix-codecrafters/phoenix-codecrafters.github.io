# StudyLink

## Overview 
Nowadays, it's pretty rare to see students interacting face-to-face with their peers. It's tough to ask for help when everyone else seems to be doing just fine. But have no fear, because StudyLink is here to help!

## Developer Guide 

## Installation
The instructions below will guide you through the process of downloading, installing, running, and modifying the application on your local device.

1. In order to begin using the application you will need to install<a href="https://www.meteor.com/install"> Meteor.</a>

2. Next, you will need to clone our repository<a href="https://github.com/phoenix-codecrafters/StudyLink"> StudyLink </a>.

3. Using any IDE of your choice (our team used IntelliJ IDEA), in the command prompt you will need to cd into the app directory (within the code-directory file) and install the Meteor library as follows:
```
meteor npm install
```
 
4. Once the libraries are installed, you can run the application by invoking:
```
meteor npm run start
```

5. The first time you run the app, it will create some default users and data. Here is the output:

```
 meteor npm run start
